    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      For my final year comprehensive creative technologies project, I decided
      to focus on the digitisation of museums. This meant exploring how
      contemporary web libraries and frameworks can be used to elevate
      interaction and using them to bring a distilled museum experience to a
      potentially wider audience.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Figma</li>
      <li>HTML, CSS, JS</li>
      <li>React JS</li>
      <li>Three JS</li>
      <li>React Three Fiber</li>
      <li>Github (version control)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ideation and Project Proposal</li>
      <li>Literature Review</li>
      <li>Prototype Demo</li>
      <li>Coming soon...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation and Project Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      Ideation required extensive research into the current, past and potential
      future landscape of museums and their relationship with digital tools.
      During this research I pinpointed specific points of interest and
      documented my research and analysis.
      <br />
      As this was my final year project, I wanted to build upon aspects that I
      had enjoyed during my time at university - user experience, the concept of
      interactivity and interaction flow, and front-end web development.
      <br />
      Due to this, I decided to push my boundaries and explore contemporary web
      development tools. I briefly researched into three of the most well known
      tools (Vue, Angular and React) before ideating on initial plans to
      implement 3D models into my design. Thus I had a direction and knowledge
      of the tools required to meet my goals.

    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
      Following feedback from my academic tutor for the project, I deepened my
      already extensive research by augmenting it with a period of User Research
      as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Academic research</li>
      <li>SWOT analysis of competitors</li>
      <li>Develop interview questions</li>
      <li>Interview potential users</li>
      <li>Data Matrix + Thematic Analysis</li>
    </ol>

      alt="Major and minor themes derived from interview transcriptions"
    />
    <p>
      I also used this time to develop my understanding of how I might
      personally evaluate my project during the design and development stages. I
      discovered the MUSETECH framework, an extremely useful collection of 121
      evaluation criteria for digital technologies in museums, and incorporated
      it into my development process.
