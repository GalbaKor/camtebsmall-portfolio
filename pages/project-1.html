    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      During 2021 I was tasked with identifying one key health issue for a
      population group, conducting user research and designing a mobile
      application prototype.
      <br />
      Initial ideation and brainstorming was performed in a group before
      splitting to develop a series of individual prototypes.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Figma, Adobe Illustrator</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ideation</li>
      <li>Initial Data Gathering</li>
      <li>Personas</li>
      <li>User Journey Maps</li>
      <li>SWOT</li>
      <li>Design Research</li>
      <li>Prototyping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      Using padlet, we brainstormed a series of health issues - establishing
      common issues before expanding on each issue to deepen our options.
      Following this process, we drafted two elevator pitches and chose our
      favoured topic - sleep deprivation issues for students.
    </p>

      alt="A brainstorming of various different ideas"
    />

    <h2>Data Gathering - Interviews and data Matrices</h2>
    <p>
      Following ideation, we comprised a list of interview questions to broaden
      our knowledge and experience of our chosen issue. <br />Data gathering
      took the form of 9 user interviews, which were transcribed and plotted
      into a data matrix. Thematic analysis was then performed to locate common
      sentiments, frustrations and goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p>
      From our thematic analysis, we constructed three personas for our intended
      user group - students. Our personas drew upon the goals and frustrations
      previously identified and the personalities reflected three distinct types
      of student with differing mental states.

      alt="A fictional mid 20s persona is displayed alongside information about him."
    />

    <h2>User Journey Maps</h2>
    <p>
      Next we constructed three user journey maps to identify user expectations,
      actions and emotions at certain points throughout their use of a healthy
      sleep app.
    </p>

      alt="The user journey map for the previous persona is displayed"
    />

    <h2>SWOT</h2>
    <p>
      I performed SWOT analysis on a series of competing healthy sleeping apps,
      using a combination of personal trial and user reviews. I identified the
      similarities between these apps and found a potential niche to capitalise
      upon with my own design.

      alt="SWOT analysis example of one of the companies resarched"
    />

    <h2>Design Research</h2>
    <p>
      As I had not designed a mobile app prior to this project, I next performed
      comprehensive contemporary research into articles exploring different
      design decisions. <br />I learnt about developing menu sizes for the
      average finger radius, how the way a phone is held alters the way that
      certain audiences use an app and the value in minimalist design. This
      helped influence my initial mid-fi prototype using Figma.
    </p>
    <image
      src="../assets/images/p1-prototype1.png"
      alt="First draft for the Simply Sleep webapp using Figma"
    />
    <p>
      After acquiring feedback for this initial design, I turned back to my
      research and focused on a clearer flow of information and higher contrast
      while retaining the core feature identity.
    </p>

      alt="Remaining 4 pages of the Simply Sleep webap"
    />
    <image
      src="../assets/images/p1-prototype4.png"
      alt="An example of how the app responds to the time of day and notifies the user"
    />

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      During this project I learnt a great deal about designing for mobile, the
      many constraints to consider and the importance of displaying the right
      amount of information in such a small form factor. <br /><br />
      I also began my first forray into using Figma and was pleasantly surprised
      by how well it functions for creating interactable prototype applications.
      <br /><br />
      I definitely left room to improve and would perform even more design
      research were I to work on a similar project. This could include the
      introduction of mood boards and a deepened knowledge of graphic design
      theory.
