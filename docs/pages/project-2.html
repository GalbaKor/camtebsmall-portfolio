    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Working under the
      <a href="https://designenterprisestudio.com/">Design Enterprise Studio</a>
      alongside a coursemate (<a href="ksenyashnurova.com">Ksenya Shnurova</a>),
      we were tasked with creating a digital trails webapp for the Winterbourne
      and Frome Valley Environmental Group.
      <br />
      This webapp would host a pilot walking route and contain text, video and
      audio information about specific points along each route - accessed when
      users scan a physical QR code at said points.
      <br />
      The project necessitated developing our project brief, greenlighting it
      with the client and iterating on design ideas. As the client was open to
      any ideas we had, We were reliant on each other to critically test and
      challenge our own ideas to achieve the best results. This resulted in an
      agile development cycle with sprints to develop each feature.

    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ideation</li>
      <li>Coding and Technical Research</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      During the ideation stage, we considered; the form the final product
      should take - a dedicated application or webapp, the target audience, the
      amount of information to be displayed and the visual theme of the project.
      <br />
      Additionally, we were presented with a design requirement that the project
      be developed such that the Frome Valley team could create new routes in
      the future.
      <br />
      Thus the initial stages consisted of gathering information from the client
      themselves and refining their idea into a consolidated design brief
      outlining the must haves and should haves for the webapp.

    <h2>Coding and Technical Research</h2>
    <p>
      Working as a front-end developer for this project required me to stretch
      my boundaries and learn a lot of new techniques in a short amount of
      time.<br />
      Since the client's existing website used Tailwind CSS, I took it upon
      myself to do the same and learn how to use Tailwind.<br />
      I was successful in my application of this framework and have even started
      using it in other projects. <br /><br />
      Perhaps the most challenging element was establishing how I would develop
      what the client described as a "collectable" feature - the idea that as a
      user walks through a route, they can get something back by using the QR
      codes. <br />
      During ideation, I proposed the idea of a quiz that could reward users
      with a sticker. This would normally require the construction of a back-end
      system to verify and validate users, but I shifted direction and instead
      learnt how to use local storage. This bypasses the need for a login system
      entirely and thus any potential ethical concerns that would arise from
      tracking user data.
